Programming mobile robot (turtlebot3) using ROS (robot operating system) to drive through desired points.

The robot is able to:-
-navigate in between two lanes
-detecte trafic signs
-avoide obstacles.
-move though a certain path (diffrent colored points), while finding the shortest path to do so.

In order to acomplish the mentioned above, the robot uses camera, laser sensor and gyroscope. After image processing and building a 2D map using the data that arive from the laser scanner, the robot can find the right path and drive through.

The robot can scan and generate a map for the enviroment that he is moving in. This process, in addtion to the other sensors, makes the whole process more accurate.
